# Accident Rate Project

An incidence rate (also known as an accident rate) is a way of measuring the safety of a workplace. The rate is calculated based on the number of accidents that happen during a particular period of time.
The Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA), the federal agency that establishes safety regulations for workplaces, has a formula for calculating incidence rates. To determine the accident rate in a workplace, start by multiplying the number of accidents by 200,000. Then divide the result by the number of labor hours.
