# Accident Rate Project

An incidence rate (also known as an accident rate) is a way of measuring the safety of a workplace. The rate is calculated based on the number of accidents that happen during a particular period of time.
The Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA), the federal agency that establishes safety regulations for workplaces, has a formula for calculating incidence rates. To determine the accident rate in a workplace, start by multiplying the number of accidents by 200,000. Then divide the result by the number of labor hours.

Accidents directly impact two crucial factors for business: money and reputation. Companies have been trying to reduce their injuries rates during the last years, indeed incidence rates have fallen 75% since 1972. Although this good metric there is still a lot of work to do. In 2019, employees in the US suffered 2.8 million workplace injuries. 

This project aims to help reduce those numbers by predicting if an employee is going to suffer an accident/injury. This prediction will help companies to avoid those dangerous situations by being more aware of them.
